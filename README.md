# Transversity
Repository for the Transversity distribution code (based on APFEL++)

Content of current directories

- EvolutionC++ = Contains C++ original source code for evolution of chiral-odd objects in APFEL++, plus some test plots

- FortranWrapper = Fortran wrapper to create a driver for evolution, both in C++ and F90, starting from the parametrization of up and down valence transversities

- hoppetReloaded2017 = Installation files for HOPPET, 2017 version

- LO evolution test = test APFEL++ evolution at LO (files test_qX.txt) by comparing with older results by HOPPET (files xh1g=u_qX.txt) for X=0,4,10 GeV^2

- Global fit 2018 = grid for transversity in 1<Q<100 GeV and 0.0001<x<1 at LO and NLO. For both cases, 600 replicas using parametrization from PRL 120 (2018) 192001, arXiv:1802.05212
