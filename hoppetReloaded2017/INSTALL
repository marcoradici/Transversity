Compilation
-----------

Makefiles for f90/95 are generated automatically using the perl script
scripts/makef95makefile. Things can be orchestrated in two ways:

New (and recommended)
--------------------
First run 

  ./configure  [options...]

which takes options

       --prefix=DIR	installs things in DIR/lib, DIR/include

       FC=fortran-compiler-name 
			uses the specified fortran compiler (default: gfortran)

       FFLAGS=fortran-compiler-options
			uses the specified fortran compiler (default: gfortran)

The configure script is written in perl and is _not_ a standard
autotools script (but the few options given above coincide with those
from autotools).

Then run

  make

  # checks that the output from running example_f90/tabulation_example
  # is sensible
  make check

  # and do this if you want to install the library
  # (currently only the library and .h files, not the module files
  # for f90 compilation).
  make install          

Note: contrary to the situation with autotools configure scripts, it
is not possible to this configure script from a directory other than
the top-level directory of the distribution.

Everything is generated from from scripts "mkmk" called in each
directory. To generate the full set of makefiles for your compiler,
type (from the main directory)

     ./mkmk compiler-name   

where compiler-name can be g95,lf95,ifort,gfortran (the latter may
give executables that crash though). This will run subsiduary mkmk
files and also set files .compiler in each directory which store the
information about the compiler being used. If you add new programs to
a directory, they will automatically be taken into account when you
rerun mkmk.

To compile the hoppet library

     cd src/
     # compile the library
     make

To compile the f90 example program 

     cd ../example_f90
     # compile the program
     make tabulation_example
     # run the program
     ./tabulation_example

The output should be compared to the file
"tabulation_example.default_output", which contains the correct
results.
